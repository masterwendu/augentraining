To prevent nearsightedness and to relax your eyes from the computer screen.

### Every evening and morning * Eye shower *
In the evening, before going to bed, treat your eyes to a shower.
* Open the tap - cold water. Then squeeze water on your closed eyes with your hands. About ten times.
* Then set the temperature to lukewarm. Even so you wet the closed eyes another ten times. That feels good!
* In the morning exactly in reverse order. That is, you start with lukewarm water and then switch to cold. This refreshes the eyes.

## Exercises
Every working day 2 - 3 exercises

* _Follow your finger (this exercise strengthens the eye muscles) _
  1. Keep your forefinger in front of your eyes with a distance of about 20 centimeters.
  2. Now point your gaze to the fingertip.
  3. Then "paint" figures, letters or numbers into the air with your forefinger - slow movements.
  4. Follow with your look the index finger tip.
  5. Gradually increase the speed of the movements until you can just follow with your eyes. Then break.
  6. After the tension, relax: Close your eyes for a while.
* _Movements in the dark (The movements train the eye muscles, but the dark relaxes them too.) _
  1. Close your eyes.
  2. Then, with your eyes closed, turn your eyes down and then up. So you only move your eyes. In each direction about ten times.
  3. Then look to the left and then to the right. Again ten times.
  4. Finally, circle your eyes with your eyes.
  5. The same procedure then with open eyes.
* _Blinzeln, what the stuff holds_
  1. Open and close your eyelids - as fast and easy as you can. The whole thing for about a minute. This trains the eye muscles and solves the "rigid look".
  2. Positive side effect: It puts a fine tear film over the eyes. And that is good.
  3. Close your eyelids for a while after this exercise and give them relaxation.
* _The sharp eye_
  1. Fix an object for a while, then let your gaze wander into the distance and repeat it several times.
* _massage_
  1. This eye massage does not massage the eyes directly, but the eye area:
  2. Grasp the bridge of your nose with your thumb and middle finger and at the same time place your index finger between your eyebrows. Then make slight movements with the three fingers.
* _Engrelax_
  1. Open your eyes wide and let your gaze wander into the distance.
* _Exercise to strengthen the eyesight_
  1. With this eye training you strengthen your eyesight:
  2. Hold one index finger approx. 15 centimeters in front of your nose, the other index finger another 15 centimeters behind.
  3. As a third point, find an object in the room a little further away.
  4. Now focus on the first index finger, then on the second and finally on the object.
  5. Repeat this process a few times in a steady rhythm. At the end of the eye exercise palming is off.
* _Light bathing reduces brightness sensitivity_
  1. Point your face to the sun with your eyes closed (!). You can also use a lamp for the exercise - depending on photosensitivity 40 to 100 watts, which you direct to about a meter away on your face.
  2. Turn the head slightly back and forth so that the light hits at different points of your closed eyes. If the sun's rays are too bright, simply turn your closed eyes against the sky.
  3. After approx. Three to five minutes, stop this eye exercise with the Palmate Exercise, depending on the sensitivity to light.
* _Another eye massage_
  1. This targeted massage causes the fastest noticeable relaxation of the eyes in many people:
  2. Place the middle fingers of both hands approximately on the middle of the forehead.
  3. Perform uniform circular motion.
  4. Slowly move your fingers sideways over your temples and then down, close to your ears, to your earlobes.
* _The third thumb_
  1. Hold both thumbs vertically upwards with a distance of about two centimeters.
  2. Then position your thumbs (keep spacing!) At arm's length equal to your eyes.
  3. Now look first at the thumbs, then at a point behind it. B. on the wall.
  4. After a few repetitions - or maybe the same - you will see a third between your two thumbs. Do not Scare. :-)
  5. Now switch between close (thumb) and remote (point on the wall) several times and pay attention to the appearance and disappearance of the "third thumb".
  6. Finish the eye exercise with palmate.
* _Lichtblitze - another exercise against the brightness sensitivity_
  1. While "bathing in light" hold your hands one behind the other at a distance of about 20 centimeters in front of your face. Move your hands. In this way, light and dark reflections appear, which act as weak flashes of light.
  2. This exercise is also completed by palming.
* _Palmieren_
  1. Palming is the following procedure:
  2. Rub your palms against each other until they radiate a pleasant warmth.
  3. Then place your hands side by side and slightly arched over the closed eyes without touching the eyelids.
  4. Keep your eyes closed. Now try - for about two minutes - to relax and completely switch off your thoughts.
  5. Allow your breath to flow smoothly and evenly.
  6. Palmieren is an excellent recovery in strenuous computer work. Perform this exercise sometimes standing. This will also relax your back.
* _Akkommodieren_
  1. Accommodation is a very effective eye exercise and relaxes the eye muscles.
  2. Cover the left eye with your left hand.
  3. Now hold your right hand with outstretched arm in front of your right eye.
  4. Look at the palm of your hand.
  5. Slowly move your hand toward the eye, placing your eye as close as possible to the palm of your hand, holding a point on your hand.
  6. Then bring your hand back to its starting position, the eye following you.
  7. After repeating this a few times, perform the exercise with the other eye.
